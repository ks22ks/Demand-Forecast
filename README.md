# Demand-Forecast
Investigating the relative merits and demerits of aggregate forecasting versus disaggregated forecasting. Aggregate forecasting is when the total demand is forecasted without considering the individual customer segments. Disaggregated forecasting is defined as multi-step forecasting, where the individual customer segments are forecasted separately, and then the total demand is obtained by aggregating the disaggregated demand.
I have used Python to write code for EDA, regression, LASSO and ARMA models for bike demand data.
